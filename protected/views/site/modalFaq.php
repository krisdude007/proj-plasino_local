<p>
    <strong>Do I need to pay to enter the sweepstakes?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    There are paid and unpaid methods of entry. You can pay to enter the sweepstakes by using a credit card via the website. You can also
    mail in a post card to enter. Please see the Term and Conditions/Official Rules for more information. Players from all over the State of Nevada can play.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What is the price to enter if I choose the paid method?</strong>

    The sweepstakes start at $1 (one US dollar) dollar to enter when using the paid method.

    <strong>Is there an age restriction?</strong>

</p>
<p>
    <strong></strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What are the hours of gameplay?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The question runs 24 hours a day with a new Sweepstake beginning every week.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>What are the questions</strong>
    <strong> like? Can I play more than once?</strong>
</p>
<p>
    Each week will have a different multiple-choice question based upon <?php echo Yii::app()->params['global']['replaceValue']; ?>, which is the first game. The questions are skill based. Players will have to
    select one answer from the two multiple-choice answers offered. The next game, Game 2, also costs $1 (one US dollar) to play, but will consist of three (3)
    questions. These questions are trivia based and will have four (4) possible answers each. You will have 15 seconds to answer each question. Each correct
    response creates one additional Sweepstakes entry for the participant. The next game, Game 3 through Game 10, each costs $1 (one US dollar) to play, but
    will consist of five (5) questions. Players can pay to play a maximum of $10 (ten US dollars) per day.
